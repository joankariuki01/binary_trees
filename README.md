BINARY TREES
Binary trees are a way to organize data in a structured manner.  Each node contains some data and can have up to two “children” nodes. Binary trees are similar in analogy to a trunk and branches - the trunk is the “root” of the tree and from there, branches (or nodes) extend outwards.

Binary trees provide an efficient way to store and search for data. In algorithms, binary trees are used  for tasks like searching, sorting,  and organizing data in a hierarchical manner. 

A binary search tree (BST) is a type of binary tree with a special property: for each node, all the nodes in its left subtree have values less than the node's value, and all the nodes in its right subtree have values greater than the node's value.

INSERT OPERATION

Inserting a new node into a binary tree involves finding the appropriate place for the new node based on its value and then adding it as a leaf node in the correct position. To insert a new node: 

Begin with the root node of the binary tree.

Compare the value of the new node you want to insert with the value of the current node.

If the new node's value is less than the current node's value, move to the left child node. If it's greater, move to the right child node.

Keep moving down the tree, comparing values and deciding which direction to go, until you reach a leaf node (i.e. a node with no children).

Once you reach a leaf node, insert the new node as a child node in the appropriate direction based on its value.

SEARCH OPERATION

The search operation in a binary tree involves finding a specific value within the tree. 

The process begins with searching from the root node of the binary tree and comparing the search value with the value of the current node

If the value you're searching for is equal to the value of the current node, you've found the node you're looking for. If the value is less than the current node's value, move to the left child node. If it's greater, move to the right child node.

If you've found the node with the desired value, return it. If the value doesn't match and there's a child node in the appropriate direction, repeat the process starting from that child node. If there's no child node in the appropriate direction, the value does not exist in the tree.

PREORDER TRAVERSAL
Preorder traversal is one of the methods used to traverse or visit all the nodes in a binary tree. In preorder traversal, you start from the root node and recursively visit each node in the following order:

Visit the current node.

Traverse the left subtree recursively.

Traverse the right subtree recursively.

INORDER TRAVERSAL
When you do an inorder traversal, you start from the leftmost node, then visit the current node, and finally visit the rightmost node. 

POSTORDER TRAVERSAL
In a postorder traversal you;

Traverse the left subtree.

Traverse the right subtree.

Visit the root.
